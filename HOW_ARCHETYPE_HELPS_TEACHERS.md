# How Archetype System Helps Teachers

## 🎯 The Big Picture

The archetype system doesn't just identify who you are—it **actively helps you find better job matches, understand your strengths, and grow professionally**.

## 🚀 How It Helps Teachers

### 1. **Smart Job Matching** ⭐ (Sprint 6 Feature)

#### Automatic Job Recommendations
- **Before:** Teachers browse ALL jobs, many irrelevant
- **After:** System shows jobs that match your archetype automatically

**How it works:**
- Schools post jobs with desired archetypes (e.g., "The Guide", "The Trailblazer")
- System matches your archetype to job requirements
- You see **personalized job feed** with match scores
- Higher match score = better fit for your teaching style

**Example:**
```
You are: "The Guide" (mentor-focused)
Job 1: Needs "The Guide" → Match Score: 15 points ⭐
Job 2: Needs "The Trailblazer" → Match Score: 3 points
Job 3: Needs "The Guide" → Match Score: 12 points ⭐

You see Job 1 and Job 3 first - they're perfect for you!
```
