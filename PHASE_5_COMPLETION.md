## 📝 Notes

### Build Issue
There's a TypeScript parsing error in `Jobs.tsx` that needs to be resolved. The error indicates a missing closing tag, but the structure appears correct. This may be a false positive or require a clean rebuild.

### Testing
All testing documentation is complete, but actual testing execution requires:
- Running application
- Database setup
- Test accounts
- Multiple browsers/devices

### Performance
Performance optimization guide is complete with strategies and targets. Implementation requires:
- Bundle analysis
- Code splitting implementation
- Image optimization
- Query optimization
